## API Integration

This repository contains a simple Flask-based API that implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The API allows users to send a grid, start position, and goal position via a POST request and returns the list of visited nodes and the path from the start to the goal. This python is meant to be used as a template 

The python template can be found here (). 

### Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.7+**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework. You can install it using `pip`.

```python
pip install flask
```

## Flutter Build
